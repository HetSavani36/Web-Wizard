    <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
    <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are both powerful layout systems, but they serve different purposes. Understanding when to use each is crucial for creating efficient and maintainable layouts.</p>
    
    <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
    <p>CSS Grid is perfect for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two-dimensional layouts</li>
      <li>Complex grid systems</li>
      <li>Overlapping elements</li>
      <li>Responsive design patterns</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Flexbox</h2>
    <p>Flexbox excels at:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-dimensional layouts</li>
      <li>Centering content</li>
      <li>Distributing space</li>
      <li>Aligning items</li>
